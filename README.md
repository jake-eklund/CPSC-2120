# CPSC-2120
Data Structures and Algorithims Class

Class Assignments
 - Implemented a Min Heap from a vector
 - Implemented a Queue using a Circular Array
 - Created a Anagram finder using a Hash Table
 - Implemented a stack for a postfix calculator
 - Implemented logic to swap nodes in a doubly linked list
 - Implemented a graph with Breadth First Search to find word similarity (word ladder)

Labs
 - Lab 1: Creates a linked list then implements a stack and queue using the linked list
 - Lab 2: Uses a stack to convert infix to postfix notation
 - Lab 3: Uses recursion to find groups in a grid
 - Lab 4: Implementation of Merge Sort, Quick Sort, linear search, and binary search
 - Lab 5: Created custom Hash Set for strings
 - Lab 6: Using spatial hashing to find the closest pair of points in a 2D plane
 - Lab 7: Implemented a randomly balanced binary search tree
 - Lab 8: Similar to the functions from lab 7 except the insertions and splitting are now based on rank instead of value
 - Lab 9: Using recursion to solve the N-Queens problem
 - Lab 10: Using Breath Fist Search to solve puzzles
 - Lab 11: Solving a NP-Hard problem using iterative refinement
